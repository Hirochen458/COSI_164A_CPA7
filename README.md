Use your CPA6 assignment and modify it in such a way to meet the following requirements.
• Add "Sign up " and "Sign in" buttons somewhere in your layout's header or navigation bar.
• Add sessions and cookies, and use flash messages to display back the result of an operation
to the users.
• Use middleware validations for creating new instances of Job, Event and User models to
validate their incoming request data before storing them into the database.
• Create a login form and link the "Sign in" button to it.
• Use passport authentication and encryption for the User model
• Add a visual indicator to show which user is logged in.
• Limit the CRUD's Create, Edit and Update functions for the Event and Job models to the
"logged in" users only.
• Provide a "Log out" button for the logged in users to log out and clear the session with a
visual indicator ( a successful log out flash message).
